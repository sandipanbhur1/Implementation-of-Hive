The description of the data is as below
1. TV show titles do not have spaces
2. Channels have 3 letters
3. TV show titles can appear multiple times, with different counts
4. A TV show and channel combination might appear multiple times
5. TV shows could appear on multiple channels
6. The output should have no commas or punctuation, only 1 space between the TV show title and number.

1. What is the total number of viewers for shows on ABC?
2. What is the number of viewers for the BAT channel?
3. What is the most viewed show on ABC channel?
4. What are the aired shows on ZOO,NOX, ABC channels ?
